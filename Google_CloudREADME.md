Google Cloud Platform Knowledge Notes

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) what it is?

In this video we are diving into GCP, Google's powerful cloud computing platform that runs everything from small startups to massive companies. 

By the end, you will be able to understand, What GCP is, and why it is important, and how you can start leveraging it. So let us jump in. Before we are able to talk about GCP, let us quickly break down cloud computing. Imagine that you actually own a restaurant. Instead of having to buy expensive kitchen equipment, you rent a professional kitchen that is everything pre-installed. 

Cloud computing works the same way. You do not need to buy or maintain expensive servers. Instead, you want computing power, storage and services by cloud providers like Google.

This not only makes it cost effective, scalable, and is superfast. Businesses no longer need to worry. As Everything is handled in the cloud which allows them to focus on what really matters and that is building their applications. Now that we know what the cloud is, let us talk about Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is Google's suite of cloud computing services that lets businesses and developers store data, applications, build AI models, and even try to manage large scale infrastructure without the need of physical hardware. 

Think of it as a giant toolbox that helps companies power their applications effectively. In fact, some of the world's biggest platforms like Spotify, Twitter, and Snapchat run on Google Cloud. And of course, Google itself uses GCP to operate services like Youtube, Gmail, and Google Search. 

So when you use GCP, you are running on the same infrastructure that powers billions of users worldwide. 

Now, you might be wondering, there are other cloud providers like AWS and Microsoft Azure.

So why do we choose Google Cloud over other cloud providers?

Powerful AI and Machine Learning: First and foremost the reason is it has powerful AI and machine learning. As google is a leader in AI, and GCP offers cutting edge tools for machine learning, natural language processing, and data analytics.

Scalability and Security: GCP runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses for its own services, meaning it is fast, reliable, and has top-tier security.

Cost and Flexibility: Google offers competitive pricing, a pay-as-you-go-model, and free-tier services that can help businesses save money.

So whether you are a developer, data scientist or a business owner, GCP gives you the tools to scale without breaking the bank

Google Cloud Services:

Google Cloud offers over 100 different services, but here are 5 that every beginner should know:

Compute Engine: This is GCP's virtual machine service. Think of it as having to rent a powerful computer in the cloud to run your applications.

Google Cloud Storage: Like the need to store files, images, or backups? Cloud Storage is like Google Drive but for businesses - fast, scalable, and highly secure.

Google Big Query: Google's data analytics engine. It helps businesses process massive datasets in seconds, and it makes perfect sense for having to make it for its data-driven decisions.

Google Cloud Functions: Want to automate tasks? Cloud functions can let you run small pieces of code in response to events, like having to send notifications when a file is uplodaded.

Google Kubernetes Engine: If you are into app development, Kubernetes is one of these services that helps you manage containerised applications, makes it easier to deploy and scale your apps efficiently.

Real-World Examples:

Spotify: It uses GCP for data analytics, as it helps recommend personalised playlists to million of users.

Twitter: It has been migrated to Google Cloud to improve its scalability and handle massive amounts of real-time data. 

Snapchat: It relies on GCP to power its cloud storage and AI-based filters.

Even NASA uses GCP for space research and simultations.
